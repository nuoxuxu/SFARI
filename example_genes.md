# Most transcripts overlapped between the two datasets
MUL1

- [ ] Count up the number of genes that have more transcripts in the SFARI dataset than Patowary
- [ ] For SCN2A, look into the coverage bias between Patowary and SFARI transcripts
- [ ] Is there a relationship between gene expression and the number of detected transcripts? Average gene expression across samples or test each time point separately
- [ ] Change dataset name from "TALON" to "Patowary"
- [ ] Add context on the abudance of the individual transcripts
- [ ] Colour novel exons
- [ ] COlour first and last exons if they have novel TSS and TES
- [ ] Calculate the number of novel exons in the SFARI dataset that overlaps with the Patowary paper
